# Setting up SQLite

## Learning Goals

- Use SQL to store data and retrieve it later on.
- Use SQLite to build relational databases on your computer.

***

## Key Vocab

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: a programming language that is used to
  manage relational databases and perform operations on the data that they contain.
- **Relational Database**: a collection of data that is organized in
  well-defined relationships. The most common type of database.
- **Query**: a statement used to return data from a database.
- **Table**: a collection of related data in a database. Composed of rows and
  columns. Similar to a class in Python.
- **Row**: a single record in a database table. Each column represents an
  attribute of the record. Similar to an object in Python.
- **Column**: a single field in a database table. Each row contains values in
  each column. Similar to a Python object’s attributes.
- **Schema**: a blueprint of the construction of the tables in a database and
  how they relate to one another.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll set up some of the tools you'll need for interacting with
a database using SQL. There is an example database included in this lesson,
`chinook.db`.
[Fork and clone this lesson](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/python-p3-setting-up-sqlite/fork)
so you can follow along.

The `chinook.db` database is provided by SQLite as a way of demonstrating some
of the features of the SQLite application. If you try to view this file in your
text editor now, you won't be able to — this is a special SQLite database file,
and as such, it has all kinds of special encoding that makes it visible only
within a SQLite application. Not to worry! We'll soon see how to interact with
all the data in this file using a couple different tools.

## Installing SQLite

### Installing SQLite in OSX

If you are on OSX version 10.4 or greater, you probably already have SQLite
installed. Find out by opening up the terminal and running:

```console
$ which sqlite3
/usr/bin/sqlite3
```

If you see the output above, you have a working version of sqlite3 already
installed on your system. Thanks Apple! Skip ahead to the 'SQLite VSCode
Extension' section below!

If not, then there are a couple of ways you can install SQLite.

#### OSX: Install With Homebrew

You can install SQLite using Homebrew, which you should have installed as part
of your Flatiron environment setup. Install SQLite with:

```console
$ brew install sqlite
```

> **Note**: We use Homebrew here in place of pip because pip is used to manage
> _Python_ libraries. SQLite can be accessed through a Python module that we
> will explore later in this module, but it is not a Python library itself.

#### OSX: Install From Binary

If Homebrew isn't working out for you, you can download one of the pre-compiled
binary packages available at the
[downloads page](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html). Look for your operating
system, download and install the appropriate binary.

> **Note:** If you are receiving an error when trying to install SQLite, make
> sure the Xcode Command-Line Tools have properly installed. Try running
> `xcode-select --install` to resolve this issue.

### Installing SQLite in WSL

Below are the steps for installing SQLite on the Windows Sub-system for Linux:

1. Open your WSL terminal
2. Update your Ubuntu packages: `sudo apt update`
3. Once the packages have updated, install SQLite3 with: `sudo apt install sqlite3`
4. Confirm installation and get the version number: `sqlite3 --version`

For additional information, check out [this article on getting started with
databases in WSL][wsl]

[wsl]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#install-sqlite

***

## SQLite VSCode Extension

To make it easier to interact with SQLite databases from VSCode, you should also
install the [SQLite VSCode Extension][sqlite vscode].

This will give you a graphical interface where you can interact with SQLite
databases without leaving VSCode! It's a great way to help visualize what's
happening with your database while you familiarize yourself with SQL syntax.

***

## DB Browser for SQLite

The last, and most comprehensive, graphical tool for interacting with SQLite
databases is DB Browser for SQLite. It's a separate, standalone graphical user
interface (GUI) application that has many features for exploring and interacting
with SQL databases.

To install it, head to the downloads page, and download the installer for your
operating system:

- [https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

For WSL users, you should download the Windows installer, not the Linux one.

***

## Trying It Out

Okay, let's make sure everything is up and running. We'll show how to explore a
database using both SQLite in the terminal as well as the VSCode extension.

### Using SQLite in the Terminal

In your terminal, type:

```console
$ sqlite3 chinook.db
```

This will open the `chinook.db` file in the SQLite prompt. You should see
something like:

```console
SQLite version 3.7.12 2013-03-19 12:42:02
Enter ".help" for instructions
sqlite>
```

You are now looking at the SQLite prompt and can now run SQL statements and
commands. Let's explore the data from one of the tables in this database. This
command retrieves all the data from the `artists` table inside the `chinook.db`
database file:

```console
sqlite> SELECT * FROM artists;
1|AC/DC
2|Accept
3|Aerosmith
4|Alanis Morissette
...
```

We'll talk more about the `SELECT` syntax in coming lessons. You can also view a
list of all the tables:

```console
sqlite> .tables
albums          employees       invoices        playlists
artists         genres          media_types     tracks
customers       invoice_items   playlist_track
```

To exit sqlite, type `.quit` at the sqlite prompt.

**Top-Tip:** All SQL statements that you write in your terminal, inside the
sqlite prompt, `sqlite>`, _must be terminated with a semi-colon `;`_. If you hit
`enter` without adding a semi-colon to the end of your line, you will be
trapped! Don't worry though, just add that `;` on the new line and hit `enter`
again. Note, however, that this does not apply to sqlite commands that begin
with a `.` such as `.quit` and `.tables`. These commands will _not work_ if you
add the semi-colon.

### Using the SQLite VSCode Extension

While it's nice to be able to interact with a SQL database directly from the
terminal, it's even nicer to be able to have a visual representation of what the
tables look like in a graphical user interface (GUI). One such GUI that we can
use without even leaving our text editor is the
[SQLite VSCode Extension][sqlite vscode].

To use it, first right-click on the `chinook.db` file, then select "Open database":

![Opening a database in SQLite Extension](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/vscode-open-database.png)

This will create a new "SQLITE EXPLORER" menu within VSCode, below the file tree:

![Locating the SQLite Explorer in VSCode](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/vscode-explore-database.png)

Clicking the play button (▸) next to any of the tables will open a new tab in
VSCode where you can see an output of all the rows in that table in a
spreadsheet-like format:

![Viewing tables in SQLite Extension](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/vscode-view-table.png)

### Using DB Browser for SQLite

#### DB Browser in OSX

First, open the DB Browser for SQLite application:

![Open DB Browser in OSX](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/osx-open-db-browser.png)

Then, select "Open Database":

![Open database in DB Browser in OSX](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/osx-open-database.png)

Finally, navigate to the directory where you cloned this lesson, and select the
`chinook.db` file:

![Open chinook.db file in DB Browser in OSX](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/osx-open-database-select-file.png)

#### DB Browser in WSL

**NOTE:** There are limitations to using DB Browser with files in a WSL
environment. This is a
[known issue](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/issues/2142) to the
developers of DB Browser. You will need to copy the database file out of your
WSL file system and into the Windows file system in order to open it in DB
Browser.

To locate the database file in the WSL file system, from your terminal, type:

```console
$ explorer.exe .
```

This will open the current directory in Windows File Explorer:

![Open WSL Directory in File Explorer](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/wsl-explorer.png)

Then, **copy** the `chinook.db` file to any folder in your Windows file system,
like the Desktop folder:

![Copy database to desktop](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/wsl-desktop.png)

Now, open the DB Browser for SQLite application:

![Open DB Browser in WSL](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/wsl-open-db-browser.png)

Then, select "Open Database":

![Open database in DB Browser in WSL](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/wsl-open-database.png)

Finally, navigate to the directory where you copied the database, and select the
`chinook.db` file:

![Open chinook.db file in DB Browser in WSL](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/wsl-open-database-select-file.png)

#### Exploring the Database

Once you've opened the database in DB Browser for SQLite, you can more easily
explore all the different tables and the data contained within. For example, you
can view a list of all tables in the database:

![View tables in DB Browser](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/db-browser-view-tables.png)

You can also view all the data from an individual table:

![View one table in DB Browser](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-3/sql-setting-up-sqlite/db-browser-browse-data.png)

You can even run SQL code directly in DB Browser!

## Conclusion

You now have three tools at your disposal for interacting with a SQLite database:

- The `sqlite3` command line interface (CLI) tool.
  - **Pros**: easy to run quick commands from the terminal
  - **Cons**: harder to memorize the syntax, and no graphical representation of
    the data
- The SQLite VSCode extension
  - **Pros**: built into the text editor, and easy to see a graphical
    representation of the data
  - **Cons**: fewer features than the CLI tool or DB Browser
- DB Browser for SQLite
  - **Pros**: can run SQL commands, AND has a graphical representation of the data
  - **Cons**: more work to load a separate application (especially for WSL
    users)

As you work through the coming lessons and familiarize yourself with SQL
databases, make sure to take advantage of each of these tools. The more
comfortable you get working with the tools, the easier you'll find it to
understand the underlying concepts of this section and gain proficiency with
SQL.
